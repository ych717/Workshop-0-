In this sketch I mainly toyed around with quads and arcs. The main goal of this sketch was for me to experiement with placement around the canvas, as I find it difficult to mentally process coordinates. While messing around with the numbers, I ended up creating a sword-like shape piercing the arc, which was pretty cool.
